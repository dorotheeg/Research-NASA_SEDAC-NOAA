Research I did through the Columbia Earth Institute and NASA SEDAC at CIESIN with NASA and NOAA lead data, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals

The poster was presented halfway through the research at the American Geospatial Union (AGU) conference in San Francisco in December 2019

Final results are showed along with some of the scrpits I made along the way, some information has to be ommited until published
